# min-modulus — Lean proof for the minimum-modulus paper

This repository is the Lean 4 formalization accompanying the paper

The main theorem of the paper is kernel-checked end-to-end: `nmin_eq` builds
with **0 errors, 0 sorries** and uses only the standard axioms
(`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`, checked with `#print axioms nmin_eq`).

The repository also formalizes Proposition 2 of the paper (optimality among
elementary abelian $`2`$-groups): if $`g_0, \dots, g_{n-1} \in (\mathbb{Z}_2)^k`$
have unique multiset sums, then $`k \ge n - 1`$, so the least such group has
order $`2^{n-1}`$. This is a separate Lean project in [`lean2/`](lean2/) —
see [lean2/README.md](lean2/README.md) for the statement, proof outline, and
verification status (also 0 sorries, standard axioms only).

## The problem and the theorem

Fix $`n \ge 2`$. A set $`A = \{a_0 < \dots < a_{n-1}\}`$ of residues in
$`\mathbb{Z}_N`$ is **valid mod $`N`$** if the all-ones multiset is the *only*
size-$`n`$ multiset drawn from $`A`$ whose sum is $`p = \sum a_i \pmod N`$.
Validity is exactly the condition under which the permanent of an
$`n \times n`$ matrix equals a single coefficient of its row-product
polynomial mod $`x^N - 1`$, extractable by a size-$`N`$ transform (a DFT over
$`\mathbb{C}`$, or a number-theoretic transform over a finite field) — so one
wants the smallest modulus $`N`$ that is still valid.

For the super-increasing set $`A = \{2^k - 1 : 0 \le k < n\}`$ the paper proves

> **Theorem.** $`N_{\min}(n) = 2^n - 2^{\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor}`$ for all $`n \ge 2`$.

The Lean development proves exactly this, for all $`n \ge 2`$ (not up to a
bound): the main theorem `nmin_eq` states
`IsLeast {N | 2 ≤ N ∧ Valid n N} (2^n − 2^m)` with `m = Nat.log 2 n`, combining
the paper's Theorem A (validity / upper bound) and Theorem B (lower bound).
That this $`N`$ is minimal over *all* residue sets (not just the
super-increasing one) remains a conjecture (Conjecture 1 in the paper,
CP-certified for $`n \le 7`$) and is not formalized.

## What is formalized

The development is stated in **`k`-space over ℕ**: a candidate multiset is
`k : ℕ → ℕ` with `∑_{i<n} k i = n`, validity is the paper's k-vector condition
with `Nat.ModEq`, and the paper's signed multiples $`V = \pm jN`$ appear only
through the congruence `M ≡ 2^n − 1 [MOD N]` on $`M = \sum k_i 2^i`$ — no
integer subtraction anywhere.

## Deviations from the paper proof

* **Theorem B** constructs the four witness representations directly by
  induction on bit-width with a parity split, instead of certifying them
  via `s_min`/popcount.
* **Theorem A** avoids popcount entirely and follows the paper's §5
  route directly. `gmin w M` (binary digits of `M` below bit `w`, plus the
  whole quotient on the top coin) is defined by the one-bit-peeling recursion
  `gmin (w+1) M = M % 2 + gmin w (M / 2)`, so every proof is an induction
  whose steps only use literal `/2`, `%2` — `omega` handles all arithmetic.
  `gmin_step` is the paper's Lemma 4 (subtraction encoded as
  `M' + 2^t = M + 2^{w+1}`), proved by bit-peeling with a parity split;
  `slack` iterates it over `j` from the base `gmin_ones`. No range
  restriction on `j`, no `Nat.log` case analysis, no small-`n` evaluations.
* Lemma 2 (`ones_unique`) is a descent on the bottom coin: parity forces
  `k 0 = 1 + 2t`, and `gmin_le_dsum` + `gmin_add_le` force `t = 0`.

## Formalization notes (kept for reference)

- `omega` treats `2^w` as an **opaque atom**, but *does* abstract nonlinear
  products (`j * N`) as atoms — provide bridging equations by `ring` and let
  omega finish linearly. Corners that are vacuous on paper via pow semantics
  need explicit case splits feeding omega the reduced facts.
- Mathlib v4.15 names: `Nat.lt_two_pow_self` (argument implicit),
  `Function.update_of_ne` / `Function.update_self`,
  `Nat.log_eq_of_pow_le_of_lt_pow` for concrete `Nat.log` values (does **not**
  reduce by `decide`).
- Goals of the form `val w (fun i => …) = …` are stated about a lambda;
  `rw`/`omega` need the beta-reduced shape — open such proofs with `show`,
  or reuse `shift_*` through a pointwise `Finset.sum_congr`.
