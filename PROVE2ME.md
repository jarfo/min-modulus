# Prove2Me mission and maintained DAG

The owner launched **The min-modulus conjecture for unique multiset sums**
as a private mission on 2026-09-10. Open [My missions](https://prove2.me/my-missions).
Mission ID: `6b060afa-1e7b-4c80-8f4a-cc89ff36784e`.
Goal theorem ID: `67fbce28-44f4-45cb-8e37-de63df56557c`.

The [platform DAG package](https://github.com/jarfo/unique/tree/main/papers/min-modulus/prove2me/platform-dag)
records 39 proved supporting nodes, accepted reductions, exact source hashes,
server theorem/submission IDs, and the complete root frontier. The goal's
three open leaves are:

- `MinModulus.two_large_parity_fibres_delete_step` (G1 residual).
- `MinModulus.odd_stratum_lower_bound` (G2).
- `MinModulus.exceptional_lift_obstruction` (G3).

G1 is reduced to its existing two-large-parity-fibres restriction. The main
reduction preserves the mission's original validity definition and exact
conjecture statement. Conjecture 1 and all three research inputs remain open.
The original abelian lower bound and canonical-family minimum remain separate
supporting proof-transfer targets in the mission.

## Verification and coverage

The supported platform environment is Lean 4.33.1 with Mathlib
`0df444a360eaa60ab8c11dca51a86af692955474`. This proof repository retains
its existing pins. The compact source port contains 102 declarations in 21
modules from commit `b615a8bbc7fb52a7700f5b8d2c6b89f86c807efb`: all 102
original types and axiom audits passed without proof-body changes.

The final platform split built 8,797 jobs. Its 39 source theorem types match
after canonicalizing universe names (38 also match without that step), all
41 independent solutions match their target types, and all 23 bundled
definition declarations pass the standard-axiom audit. Server verification
establishes the accepted graph edges.

The [DAG plan](https://github.com/jarfo/unique/blob/main/papers/min-modulus/prove2me/dag-plan.md)
also records the primitive and quantitative refinements of the same three
gates. Their full source closure reaches 19,760 declarations in 725 modules,
including generated declarations; they have not all been ported. Recent
strict-growth and escape-density results need a further argument connecting
them to an open gate. The unrestricted common-touch assertion is false and
must not reappear as an open sufficient lemma.

## Continue after each verified milestone

Build new statements and proofs on a currently supported platform revision,
compare their source types and audit their axioms, then publish any new
prerequisites and submit the checked proof or reduction. Retain the private
visibility. Accepted reductions supply dependencies; milestone ordering
supplies an attack order. Choose one direction when using an equivalence so
the proof graph remains acyclic.

Refresh the goal graph and every page of its open leaves, update the source
commit and theorem/submission IDs, and commit and push both repositories.
Then continue with a connected open obligation, considering closability,
tractability and reuse. The package's maintenance script supports publish,
prove and refresh operations; credentials remain in the user's Prove2Me
workspace and are never committed.

The original four-item proposal, independent blind readbacks, and initial
8,716-job statement build are preserved in the
[initial bundle](https://github.com/jarfo/unique/tree/main/papers/min-modulus/prove2me).
